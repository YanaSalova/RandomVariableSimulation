# RandomVariableSimulation
This repository implements and analyzes methods for simulating random variables, focusing on acceptance-rejection. Tasks include proving correctness, studying the complexity of simulating a standard normal distribution from a symmetric exponential distribution, and comparing it with the Box-Muller method.
